# GroundedSAM-zero-shot-anomaly-detection
This project aims to segment any anomaly without any training. We develop this interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)! 
Most of the codes are borrowed from [Grounded Segment Anything](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything). Thanks to their excellent work!


**Why this project?**
- [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) is a strong segmentation model. But it need prompts (like boxes/points) to generate masks. 
- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) is a strong zero-shot detector which enable to generate high quality boxes and labels with free-form text. 
- The combination of the two models enable to **detect and segment everything** with text inputs!
- In real world industrial inspection applications, models trained with zero or few normal images, is essential in many cases as defects are rare with a wide range of variations.


**Imagine Space**

Some possible avenues for future work ...
- Stronger foundation models with segmentation pre-training.
- Collaboration with (Chat-)GPT.
- More advanced normality- and abnormality-specific prompts for better zero-shot anomaly detection performance.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install GroundingDINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
```


The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.
```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```

More details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install)


## :running_man: Run Grounded-Segment-Anything Demo
- Download the checkpoint for segment-anything and grounding-dino:
```bash
cd $ProjectRoot
mkdir weights
cd ./weights
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
```

- Run demo
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python zero_shot_ad_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint weights/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --input_image assets/wood_demo.png \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.15 \
  --text_threshold 0.15 \
  --area_threshold 0.70 \
  --text_prompt "defects" \
  --device "cuda"
```
- The model prediction visualization will be saved in `output_dir`.
